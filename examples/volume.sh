# Simple script to create a block and update it with the current date and time

# job with the pattern '* * * * *' to run it every minute just in case something
# else changed the volume.

# Technically the mute and volume awk scripts could both be placed in one
# statement and not require the paste. But this requires the order of 'pactl
# list sinks' to always list mute status before volume, which I wasn't sure
# would always be the case.
